ObservableJS
============

Two way dynamic binding directly to object properties in JavaScript, without accessor functions. DOM binding is in a similar style to [Knockout JS](http://knockoutjs.com/). ObservableJS is not meant to be a complete replacement for larger libraries, but is an interesting experiment and is a lightweight alternative for some use cases.

Supported browsers are (should be):
 * IE 9+
 * Firefox 4+
 * Safari 5.1+
 * Chrome 5+
 * Opera 12+

Currently supported bindings are:
 * class
 * foreach
 * html
 * text
 * value
 * visible

Standard Array functions are supported/observed as well.
